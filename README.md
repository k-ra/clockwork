## FEEDBACK NOTES

Change button color to show that it is pressed (shift down and make darker)

Think about lower time increments (what will it look like?)

Will it support multiple days (what would that look like?)

Have something to reflect total people and number out of total

undo, hover, 

writeup: more days, limitations and challenges of library, 30 min block, talk ab 
svelte versus flask

change submit button color to something other than gray
