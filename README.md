## FEEDBACK NOTES

- [X] Change button color to show that it is pressed (shift down and make darker)

- [X] Add a hover effect showing the number of people available in a slot

- [X] Change submit button color to something other than gray

## EXTENSION 
- Think about lower time increments (what will it look like?)

- Will it support multiple days (what would that look like?)
- - Yes, the next step would be to implement a bar on the bottom with the other dates in bubbles, like (Feb 3) (Feb 5) (Feb 6), and the user can toggle between the options and have both the input calendar and the availability chart update.
