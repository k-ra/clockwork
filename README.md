## FEEDBACK NOTES

- [X] Change button color to show that it is pressed (shift down and make darker)

- [ ] Add a hover effect showing the number of people available in a slot

- [ ] Think about lower time increments (what will it look like?)

- [ ] Will it support multiple days (what would that look like?)

- [ ] undo, hover, 

- [ ] writeup: more days, limitations and challenges of library, 30 min block, talk ab 
svelte versus flask

- [ ] change submit button color to something other than gray
